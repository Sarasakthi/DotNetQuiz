    "Option 1": "[Route]",
    "Option 2": "[Action]",
    "Option 3": "[Controller]",
    "Option 4": "[HttpGet]",
    "Correct Response": "1",
    "Explanation": "To specify a route for an action method using attribute routing in ASP.NET Core, you would use the [Route] attribute. This attribute allows you to define the URL pattern that maps to the action method, giving you fine-grained control over routing behavior."
  },
  {
    "Question": "When using attribute routing, what is the significance of the order in which routes are defined?",
    "Option 1": "The order defines the priority of routes",
    "Option 2": "The order determines the route's visibility",
    "Option 3": "The order affects route naming",
    "Option 4": "The order is irrelevant",
    "Correct Response": "1",
    "Explanation": "In attribute routing, the order of route definitions is significant because it determines the priority of routes. Routes are evaluated in the order they are defined, and the first matching route is used. This allows you to control which route handles a particular request when there are multiple possible matches."
  },
  {
    "Question": "Which attribute would be used to enforce that a specific route parameter should be of type integer?",
    "Option 1": "[Route]",
    "Option 2": "[HttpGet]",
    "Option 3": "[FromRoute]",
    "Option 4": "[RegularExpression]",
    "Correct Response": "3",
    "Explanation": "The [FromRoute] attribute is used to bind a route parameter to an action method parameter in ASP.NET Core. If you want to enforce that the parameter should be of a specific type, like integer, you can add the appropriate data type constraint in your action method's parameter using C# data type annotations."
  },
  {
    "Question": "If you want a route to match only when a specific query string is present, which type of route constraint can you use?",
    "Option 1": "Regex",
    "Option 2": "Range",
    "Option 3": "Required",
    "Option 4": "Bool",
    "Correct Response": "3",
    "Explanation": "To match a route only when a specific query string is present, you can use the \"Required\" route constraint. This constraint ensures that the specified query parameter is included in the request, making the route match only when the query string contains that parameter."
  },
  {
    "Question": "How can you define a route in ASP.NET Core to be available only for specific HTTP methods using attribute routing?",
    "Option 1": "[HttpPut], [HttpPost]",
    "Option 2": "[HttpGet], [HttpPost]",
    "Option 3": "[HttpDelete], [HttpGet]",
    "Option 4": "[HttpPatch], [HttpPut]",
    "Correct Response": "2",
    "Explanation": "In ASP.NET Core, you can specify the HTTP methods a route should be available for using attributes like [HttpGet] or [HttpPost] above the controller action method. For example, [HttpGet] ensures the route is available for HTTP GET requests, and [HttpPost] for HTTP POST requests."
  },
  {
    "Question": "When designing attribute routes, which approach helps in preventing route conflicts?",
    "Option 1": "Use of route parameters",
    "Option 2": "Use of a unique route name",
    "Option 3": "Use of multiple route attributes",
    "Option 4": "Use of query string parameters",
    "Correct Response": "2",
    "Explanation": "Preventing route conflicts in attribute routing is achieved by providing a unique name to each route using the \"name\" parameter in the [Route] attribute. This ensures that routes are distinct and won't conflict with each other."
  },
  {
    "Question": "What is the significance of using the [RoutePrefix] attribute in conjunction with other route attributes?",
    "Option 1": "It defines the root URL for all actions in the controller",
    "Option 2": "It defines a custom route constraint",
    "Option 3": "It enables route versioning",
    "Option 4": "It specifies a default route value",
    "Correct Response": "1",
    "Explanation": "The [RoutePrefix] attribute is used to define a common root URL for all actions within a controller. When applied, it prepends a specified route prefix to all the routes within that controller. This helps in organizing and grouping related routes under a common URL segment."
  },
  {
    "Question": "The [_______________] attribute in ASP.NET Core is used to specify the route template for an action method.",
    "Option 1": "Route",
    "Option 2": "HttpPost",
    "Option 3": "Authorize",
    "Option 4": "ValidateAntiForgeryToken",
    "Correct Response": "1",
    "Explanation": "In ASP.NET Core, the [Route] attribute is used to define the route template for an action method. This template determines how the URL should be structured to access the method. For example, [Route(\"api/products\")] specifies that the method should be reachable at the URL \"api/products."

    "Option 2": "Quantity",
    "Option 3": "Visibility",
    "Option 4": "Length",
    "Correct Response": "1",
    "Explanation": "Route constraints enable you to define restrictions on the data that can be matched by a route parameter. This restriction is usually based on the type of data expected for the parameter. For example, {id:int} enforces that the id parameter must be an integer type."
  },
  {
    "Question": "Using the {id:int} syntax in an attribute route enforces that the id parameter must be of type",
    "Option 1": "String",
    "Option 2": "Integer",
    "Option 3": "Double",
    "Option 4": "DateTime",
    "Correct Response": "2",
    "Explanation": "The {id:int} syntax in an attribute route specifies that the id parameter must be of type integer. This is a way to ensure that the data passed in the URL is an integer value, and if it's not, the route won't match."

  {
    "Question": "In attribute routing, the [Route(\"products/{id}\", Order = 2)] attribute will prioritize this route _______________ other routes with no order specified.",
    "Option 1": "over",
    "Option 2": "above",
    "Option 3": "before",
    "Option 4": "instead of",
    "Correct Response": "2",
    "Explanation": "In attribute routing, when specifying the 'Order' property, a lower value indicates a higher priority. So, the route with 'Order = 2' will prioritize this route above other routes with no order specified. This allows you to control the order in which routes are matched and executed."
  },

  {
    "Question": "The [Route(\"{action=Index}\")] attribute specifies a default value for the action, which in this case is",
    "Option 1": "Default",
    "Option 2": "Action",
    "Option 3": "Index",
    "Option 4": "Value",
    "Correct Response": "3",
    "Explanation": "In this attribute route, the [Route(\"{action=Index}\")] attribute specifies that if the 'action' parameter is not provided in the URL, it defaults to \"Index.\" This is a useful way to set default actions for controller methods when no specific action is mentioned in the route."
  },
  {
    "Question": "Imagine you have two action methods in your controller: one for handling the creation of products and another for displaying a specific product's details based on its ID. How can you utilize attribute routing to distinguish these two methods?",
